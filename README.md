# Fruit Jam
Fruit Jam is a 2D RPG where the player turns sentient fruits into jam to obtain various powers, then uses those jam powers to defeat even more fruits!

# Game Description
Fruit Jam is a 2D isometric RPG drawn in a pixel-art style where the player takes on the role of a human in a world full of sentient fruits. The game is built fully in Unity with art drawn in Photoshop. The target audience are those who like playing relaxing exploration games, but with a fair share of enemy-battling involved (notable similar games are Pokemon, Digimon, Zelda, etc., where the player can enjoy open areas full of various creatures to defeat). The game is meant to be played on PC using a keyboard and mouse. A narrative story leads the game, but it is by no means a linear experience. The player may choose to complete side quests, or ignore missions entirely and simply explore the lands as much as they want.

# Narrative
One day, on your way to work, you appear to be stuck in a traffic jam when suddenly a jar of fruit jam comes crashing through your windshield. As you turn to pick it up, a mysterious force jams you straight into the bottle itself, and when you come to, you find yourself in a mysterious world full of life-sized fruits who can act of their own volition. You hear that a great evil has risen into this world, and it is your job as the hero of legends to turn the evil fruits into jam, load your jam gun, and fire away with your new jam powers to save the realm of the fruits, and on your way, may find clues to returning to your own world.

# Game Idea
I came up with the idea of defeating sentient fruits because as an avid player of a lot of the franchises I listed earlier, like Pokemon, games that create areas with cool creatures to battle that all have their own special abilities appeal to me greatly, and surely since those franchises are massive, there are tons of people who are interested in that concept. However, there are tons of games like that, so why aren’t they all popular? The most popular games always bring something unique to the table. In the case of Pokemon, an appeal is that you can tame and catch these creatures, then use them to battle other ones. In the case of Zelda, an appeal is that you can explore vast and challenging dungeons, all while learning about the ways these creatures behave. So, in the case of Fruit Jam, I came up with the idea of the jam gun, a weapon that allows the player to obtain the abilities of the enemies themselves to use it against them. For instance, if the player is exploring a certain area and comes upon a fruit with a crazy power, what is more satisfying to the player than being able to use that power themselves?

# Gameplay
In my current iteration of the game, there are two areas that the player can travel through: the starting/respawn area that serves as a fruit village, and an expansive open area that features grassy plains. The gameplay consists of starting from the village and going to many different open areas, encountering various fruits, turning them into jam, and bringing them back to the villages. The village has an area called the science lab, where jams are tapped into to unlock their powers. The player can then return to the wild area and try out their new powers, defeat more fruits, and the cycle repeats. The story allows the player to progress through the areas and level up, increasing their stats and enabling them to take on stronger fruits. Each individual area is fully explorable when first unlocked, but the player does not have the means of defeating the stronger fruits in the areas, so exploring will just lead to death. Each area will have a recommended level so that the player knows what they are getting themselves into. For instance:
- Area 1: Grassy Plains (Recommended Level: 1 - 3)
- Area 2: Craggy Mountains (Recommended Level: 4 - 6)

Even though the recommended level from area 1 caps at 3, this does not mean that a level 3 player will be able to defeat the strongest creatures in the area, but rather they will be able to explore the majority of the area at that point. The Grassy Plains is the first area in the game, and is the only one accessible in my prototype. It features a variety of fruits, notably the first introductory enemy known as the Apple. Each creature in the game has its own moveset and AI patterns, although the Apple’s is very simple, because it is a basic introductory enemy. The Apple has the ability to spew flames at the player. Turning it into jam allows the player’s gun to become a flamethrower. There is also the enemy known as the Pear. This enemy appears to be non-hostile at first, considering its happy expression, but if the player gets too close, it will show its true self. At a certain spot in each area lies a boss fruit, one that is considerably large, has more attacks in its moveset, and is far, far stronger than a regular fruit. Defeating this boss fruit will usually be the goal of the main quest line, and doing so will give the player access to the next area.

My plan is to make each area have at least ten different fruits, because that would fit the size of the area I plan on having. Different fruits have different natures on being part of a group. For example, fruits such as berries like to be together in a group, so when a player encounters a Berry in the wild, they will usually have to fight off multiple at a time. Other fruits like Pineapple prefer to be alone, so there will only be one Pineapple if ever encountered by a player. On top of the ten fruits that commonly appear in the area, there will be very rare chances that special fruits will spawn in the area that give an exclusive jam. However, these special fruits will drop more of that jam than normal fruits, because the player would feel disappointed if they were to run out of special jam immediately, since the chance of obtaining these jams in the first place is so low. Here is a sample image of what a player may see in the wild:

<img src=./images/wild_area.png>

The main/starting area, the Fruit Village, consists of dirt roads, a lake, a shopping district, the science lab, a government building, and many houses for commoners. The map that I have planned right now is as such:

<img src=./images/town_map.png>

In every location that the dirt road touches the border of the map is an exit to a different open area. Whenever the game has an “update” and a new area is added, all I need to do is extend the dirt road and make a new exit. Currently, the Grassy Plains is accessed via the left border. As explained earlier, the lab is where the player can extract the powers of their jam and load it into their jam gun. The houses are simply there for worldbuilding but can be entered and the fruits inside spoken with. Sometimes, they may even give out side quests for the player to complete and gain gold. The shopping district contains special items that aid the player on their adventure. This includes defensive items like potions and aggressive items like fruit peelers that can be used in the wild area to set traps. The player can also sell jams to vendors in return for gold. This offers a secondary method of obtaining currency rather than simply completing quests. Sometimes, certain merchants in the shopping district will sell exclusive rare jams at a high price, if they player can afford it. These merchants are. . . human? Yes, the player will, at certain times, come upon other humans in this world of fruits, but these humans don’t recall their backstory. The only humans who can be encountered in the village are these traveling merchants, but in the open area, there are a few different types of humans waiting. Some, like these merchants, sell goods to the player without needing to return to the village. Others will assist the player in fighting fruits for a limited time. The other fruits talk about them as aliens, but they know that they are not the “chosen one” because they do not wear a suit like the player. The lake is also simply for worldbuilding, because I figured that fishing would not be a pastime in this universe. I do plan on having, however, a fruit who figured out how to attack string to a stick and sits on the edge of the lake with this impromptu fishing rod cast out. When spoken to, they will tell the player that a magical force drove from the skies told them to do this in their dreams. Lastly, the government building is the central hub that runs the player’s main story. The leaders of the village can be found there, and they are in charge of giving the player the main quests and progressing the player’s adventure. In return, they give large amounts of gold, whereas side quests only give a small amount of gold.

# Game Creation (Unity)

As previously stated, I created this game using Unity. I created a ton of features, and here I will showcase the major ones that are important to the game. To begin, there is the feature of actually moving and playing the game. Here is the Unity screen:

<img src=./images/unity_screen1.png>

The player does not actually exist on a surface, but instead is in the foreground while the plains are in the background. Since gravity is turned off, the player can move around freely. The creatures are in the same view level as the player, so they can interact and collide with the player. When I hit the play button, the game is playable, but this is the only way to currently play it, as I do not have an executable file yet. Here is a picture of the gameplay:

<img src=./images/unity_screen2.png>

This is how the road in the village currently looks. In the future, I would like to add a bunch of objects that exist and can be collided with in the village to make it look more natural. I also think that the roads need to be more fluid, rather than just straight with some turns. If I were to go to the far left of this road until I reach the border, I could walk into the border to be teleported to the area in the first image above (can’t show this in an image, sadly).

Unity requires more coding than I originally thought, and in my project, I made around 20 C# scripts so far. For these, I used Visual Studio to create, which has direct integration with Unity. Here is an example method of some code to damage the player when colliding with an enemy:

<img src=./images/unity_screen3.png>

And here is the player taking damage:

<img src=./images/unity_screen4.png>

As you can see, a number appears above the player and the healthbar in the top left (it is tiny due to my screen having a large resolution, and I haven’t been able to fix that) indicates how much damage has been taken. Although this can’t be shown in the picture, the player also flashes when damage is taken and is invulnerable during this time (2 seconds).

# Game Creation (Photoshop)

I have a huge interest in art, so I decided to make the art for this game myself rather than grab some royalty-free artwork online. This took more time than I had originally expected, and led to me not having a playable version in time for the in-class playtests. At the least, I made something that looks good, in my opinion. I studied a lot about pixel art creation, and after countless iterations of models over and over again, I ended up with the current artwork for the prototype. If I were to continue this game in the future, I would definitely still keep iterating on the art. To me, since the art of the game is the first thing the player sees, it is absolutely essential to have it be perfect, since first impressions are of great importance. If the first image of the game that the player sees doesn’t suit their tastes, then that may be the make-it-or-break-it for the player; they may not even read the description or watch gameplay footage if they don’t like the first thing they see (this is why many games have pre-rendered videos that look nothing like their gameplay). With all that being said, here is an example of the Photoshop interface:

<img src=./images/photoshop_screen1.png>

This image shows the creation of the player character and his walking animations. There are three frames for each direction, and together this is known as a spritesheet. When exported into Unity as a .png file, these can be used to animate the player’s movements whenever a button is pressed. Each frame takes up a different layer in Photoshop so that they can be individually edited without damaging the other ones. Since Photoshop is normally a software for editing normal pictures taken by people, I had to modify the settings greatly to make it functional for pixel art design. To draw, I used the pencil tool and set it to a size of exactly one square pixel, so that whichever color I select will fill only one pixel, and I went from there drawing each individual pixel on a character.

It is important for a game to have a clean aesthetic in which the art style is the same throughout and the colors blend together fluidly. I had encountered difficulty with both of these tasks in the past, so I prioritized finding a solution to those problems. In the case of keeping a consistent art style, I iterated on the design of the character based on the designs on the enemies. To put it more simply, a player can look like a billion different things in pixel art and is different in every game. However, fruits have a very distinct shape, so they are easier to draw first and get to a point where I think they fit my vision for the game. Once I had the original Pear and Apple drawn for my game. I thought about what I wanted my player character to look like. Originally, I had this design on the left below for my character that contained a more human-like appearance, but after trying more and more things, I decided on this design on the right because I felt like it would better to appropriate the player to the world itself (the player is rounder because fruits are commonly round). I also added an outline to all my sprites, because it fit the cartoony feel of the game.

<img src=./images/photoshop_screen2.png>

The second problem discussed earlier was the necessity to blend all the colors together fluidly. To solve this issue, I looked up premade pixel art palettes online that come with a very limited number of colors, but have been handpicked by very experienced pixel artists because they blend together very naturally. The first palette I chose was a 32-color palette, but as I made more and more sprites, I realized that this palette was lacking in colors that I needed, so I switched to a different 64-color palette and had to manually recolor all my sprites with the new colors. Here is the final palette I chose:

<img src=./images/photoshop_screen3.png>

For the tiles, they were made similar to the spritesheet above, but is worth mentioning because they were imported into Unity a different way. Here is a sample tileset, the one I made for the grass and dirt roads:

<img src=./images/photoshop_screen4.png>

Once I made these tiles, I used a software called Tiled to make full expansive maps. Tiled takes a .png tileset, then allows the player to select those tiles as if they were brushes and simply drag to make an entire level. It even has support for multiple layers that are directly compatible with Unity, so I was able to add collision to certain areas of the maps to make it impossible for the player to walk through. However, these maps cannot be directly exported as a .png into Unity if I wanted to keep the extra layers, so I used a very simple software called Tiled2Unity that exports these maps directly into my Unity project in the form of a .prefab file. Here is a sample screen in Tiled:
